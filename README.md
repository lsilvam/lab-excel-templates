Here are the Excel templates (`.xltx`) that I created and used in the laboratory.

Brief description of each one
1. 01_template_EBs_beating_foci
   1. a template to log raw data from embryoid bodies beating foci count with a pre-built plot
2. 01a_template_EBs_beating_foci
   1. a template to log raw data from embryoid bodies beating foci count following tidy data format to be analyze in R
3. 02_template_Bradford_96wellplate
   1. a template to paste plate reader data to automatically create a calibration curve, and then to calculate sample protein concentration and sample volumes for Western Blot
4. 03_template_primers
   1. a template to save information about primers
5. 04_template_design_qPCR
   1. a template to prepare experimental design of qPCR experiment to automatically calculate mastermix and sample volumes, with a sheet to store raw Cq from the reader
6. 05_template_mycoplasma_mastermix
   1. a template to calculate mastermix volumes for PCR mycoplama testing using PCR kit from NZYtech
7. 06_template_design_hangingDrop_differentitation
   1. a template to plan hanging drop differentitiation to termine the number of cells needs as well as the total number of plates for the experiment. And it generates automatically a csv that can be import to a calendar with the important time points of the experiment
8. 07_template_qPCR_analysis_ChIP_fold_enrichment
   1. a template to calculate ChIP enrichment with pre-built plot, considering the enrichment relative to the % input (or total DNA). It also uses a correction to the Cq of the input.
9.  08_template_qPCR_analysis_ddCt_taylor_et_al_2019
    1.  a template to calculate relative expression of genes following the ddCt method as in [Taylor et al. 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30654913/)
10. 09_template_transfection_exp_design
    1.  a template to calculate amount of DNA (plasmid) and Lipofectime2000 to prepare a transfection mix.
11. 10_template_experiment_metadata_microscopy
    1.  a template to create metadafile to be imported to CellProfiller so that the images are automtically matched to their respective experiment metadata (e.g. experimental groups)
12. 11_template_westernBlot_quatification
    1.  a template to "quantify" western blots with data from ImageJ, with pre-built plot for three experimental conditions and t-test

These are templates that I created for me need and for my use. Use them at your own risk. If you find errors, please open an issue.
